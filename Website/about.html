          <h3>How My Opinion Changed</h3>
          <p>From a very young age I lsitened to whatever my dad listened to. He was born in the early 70's, so he liked all of the <strong>hard</strong> rock from the 70's and beyond. When the 90's came around my dad got into North Western Grunge bands like Nirvana and Alice in Chains. From a young age I was listening to this combanation of music: 70's Hard Rock and 90's Grunge. When I got older around my middle school years I found out about Eminem and that sparked my intrest in rap. Also around this time I started getting into 2000's punk rock (similar to the 90's grunge) with bands like Linkin Park and Blink-182. For a long time that's what I listened to. When I got to highschool I started listening to exclusively rap music and grew very fond of the synthetic beats and the deep intellectual lyrics. When I graduated and found more people with an intrest in Rock I went back to my roots and re-deicovered all the songs I hadn't listened to in years. And out of that spawned my intrest in alternative rock with bands like Cage The Elephant.

          <p>My name is Doug and I love music. I am currently a college student at Kettering University in Michigan. I decided to build this website so that I can learn about building websites and also as a way to classify all of the types of music that I listen to. It was a very fun task and I feel like I learned a lot doing it.</p>
          <p>Over the past 3 months I have developed a more refined taste in music as I was exposed to many new genres and artists by friends that I have made in recent times. As a child, I grew up in New York, so all of my friends at the time were all about East Coast Rap and my dad listened to a lot of classic rock and grunge. Those were the two genres that I remember listening to as a young kid. As I got older I started forming my own tastes and intrests in music. Now looking at my music on my phone I realized that it all fits into 3 categories: Rap, Rock and Pop.</p>
